>Rust is an excellent programming language that simultaneously optimizes for both safety and performance in a way few languages can claim. The Rust core team has created a language that allows for grizzled veteran C++ developers and absolute newcomers alike to develop production-ready, systems-level code as swiftly and confidently as ever.

### Lifetimes

[Lifetimes ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.9.0/book/lifetimes.html)

Rust’s ownership system:
ownership, the key concept
borrowing, and their associated feature ‘references’
lifetimes, which you’re reading now

[Understanding Rust Lifetimes. No, seriously, this time for real  by Maksym Zavershynskyi  NEAR Protocol  Medium ](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/understanding-rust-lifetimes-e813bcd405fa)

>lifetimes are all about references, and nothing else.

>For example, when we see a struct with a lifetime type-parameter it refers to the lifetimes of the references owned by this struct and nothing else. There is no such thing as a lifetime of a struct or a closure, there are only lifetimes of the references inside the struct or the closure.

>The borrowing rules state: At no point in the code, there are references to overlapping pieces of memory, a.k.a aliasing, such that at least one of them is used to mutate the content of the memory.


>If you have multiple references, you can use the same lifetime multiple times:
```rs
fn x_or_y<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
```
>This says that x and y both are alive for the same scope, and that the return value is also alive for that scope. If you wanted x and y to have different lifetimes, you can use multiple lifetime parameters:

```rs
fn x_or_y<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &'a str {
```
>In this example, x and y have different valid scopes, but the return value has the same lifetime as x.



>Named lifetimes are a way of giving these scopes a name. Giving something a name is the first step towards being able to talk about it.

>String literals have the type `&'static str` because the reference is always alive: they are baked into the data segment of the final binary.
```rs
let x: &'static str = "Hello, world.";
```

Lifetime Elision


### traits

[Abstraction without overhead: traits in Rust  Rust Blog ](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html)
Previous posts have covered two pillars of Rust's design: 1) Memory safety without garbage collection, 2) Concurrency without data races
This post begins exploring the third pillar: 3) Abstraction without overhead
>zero-cost abstraction
>"C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you don't use, you don't pay for [Stroustrup, 1994]. And further: What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better." -- Stroustrup

The cornerstone of abstraction in Rust is traits:

>Traits are Rust's sole notion of interface. A trait can be implemented by multiple types, and in fact new traits can provide implementations for existing types. On the flip side, when you want to abstract over an unknown type, traits are how you specify the few concrete things you need to know about that type.

>Traits can be statically dispatched. Like C++ templates, you can have the compiler generate a separate copy of an abstraction for each way it is instantiated. This comes back to the C++ mantra of "What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better" -- the abstraction ends up completely erased.

>Traits can be dynamically dispatched. Sometimes you really do need an indirection, and so it doesn't make sense to "erase" an abstraction at runtime. The same notion of interface -- the trait -- can also be used when you want to dispatch at runtime.

>Traits solve a variety of additional problems beyond simple abstraction. They are used as "markers" for types, like the Send marker described in a previous post. They can be used to define "extension methods" -- that is, to add methods to an externally-defined type. They largely obviate the need for traditional method overloading. And they provide a simple scheme for operator overloading.

>All told, *the trait system is the secret sauce* that gives Rust the ergonomic, expressive feel of high-level languages while retaining low-level control over code execution and data representation.

* Can't build cyclic structures (tree of widgets with parent/child pointers).
* Can't cast `&Rc<RefCell<T>>` as `&Rc<RefCell<Trait>>`.
